Codeigniter Library for Payone-API Access
=======================================
[Payone](http://www.payone.de/) is a german payment system with several product options and clearings. To use Payone you'll need to signup with them first of course. To get started try the (somewhat old) payone demos first. They seam to run on PHP < 5.3 right out of the box.

The library is translated from CakePHP Component. There are new functions created for Bank and PayPal Payments, account validations etc.
